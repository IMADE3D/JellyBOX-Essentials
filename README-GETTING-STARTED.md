### One-on-One Help
- If you ever encounter any issues during your building or printing, go to [imade3d.com/support](http://imade3d.com/support) and join our live chat support, email [support@imade3d.com](goto:support@imade3d.com), or tweet at [@yesIMADE3D](https://twitter.com/yesIMADE3D).

## IMADE3D 'JB ESSENTIALS' SD CARD
- By default, we ship the JellyBOX with an SD card pre-loaded with a selection of 3D models, ready-to-print files, and links to documentation and additional downloads.
- If you ever lose or delete this card, you can download the latest version as a zip archive at our JB ESSENTIALS GitHub:  [github.com/IMADE3D/JellyBOX-Essentials/releases](https://github.com/IMADE3D/JellyBOX-Essentials/releases).

## HOW TO USE JELLYBOX
- [imade3d.com/support](http://imade3d.com/support)
- I think I already mentioned this.

## CURA 2
- 3D models need to be processed or 'sliced' to be 3D-printable (we go into more detail in the Docs.)
- We recommend using Cura as your first all-purpose slicer. It is open-source, free, and always rapidly improving.
- More info, installation guide, setup... on the [imade3d.com/support](http://imade3d.com/support)

## GCODES - ready to print
- gcode is a 3D file processed for 3D printing.
- These are READY-to-PRINT. Just select using the LCD controller.
- There's a basic cube, spiralized cube, small duck sliced for TPU (rubber) and PLA, little articulated print-in-place fish, and finally the uber-popular hybrid gear bearing (modeled by Whosawhatsis) and sliced as a single-wall quick print.
- **Alert: You can only run compatible gcodes - at the very least they must have G28; G29; at the beginning.**
  - All gcodes sliced with our presets are compatible.
  - If you don't know what this means, head over to [imade3d.com/support](http://imade3d.com/support) and take it slow

## 3D MODELS - ready to slice
  - you can experiment with slicing on these without having to go fishing for files online first. We also include a good range of calibration objects so you can perfect your slicing skill.
  - Get more models at [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/), [Youmagine](https://www.youmagine.com/), [Yeggi](http://www.yeggi.com/).
  - Or, get 3D modeling with [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/), [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/), or [Fusion360](http://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview).
  - Or any other 3D modeling program.

## Firmware-Marlin
- Firmware is the brains of the printer. Or, it's the code that determines how the brain functions. Over time, we add features and fix mistakes of the past, which makes JellyBOX work better. When there is a new firmware version, you should upgrade.
- To upgrade your firmware, please head over [imade3d.com/support](http://imade3d.com/support) or straight to our [github.com/IMADE3D/Marlin/releases](https://github.com/IMADE3D/Marlin/releases)
- There's instructions on Upgrading Firmware in the infamous JellyBOX Docs though [imade3d.com/support](http://imade3d.com/support))
